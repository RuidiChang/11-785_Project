## Abstract
Human facial recognition has grown to be an important topic in deep learning field.
There is much different research about different aspects of analyzing human face
and the applications of these deep learning models are widely used in the daily life
such as security monitor, artificial intelligence, and cartoon face generation.
Human age classification from images in recent years has become popular
with the increasing number of social platforms and social medias. Various models
can be applied to more fields such as detecting criminals, makeup industries,
intelligent furniture, or other fields in daily life. We applied existing models
and designed new architectures and apply to the dataset and see whether we can
improve this kind of research result.
In this project, we decide to design and build ResNet and VGG models
used to classify the facial images by age. The architecture will be build based
on the research paper and what we learn in classes. The model to be able to
identify the age of a person by scanning their image from UTKFaces database,
comparisions and evaluation are made accross all the models, in some respects
such as faster converging speed, better accuracy, or other aspects.

## Technologies
Technologies used:
* ResNet Model
* CNN Model

## Status
Project is: to be continued.

## Dataset
Project was created using the dataset from https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/.

## Resnet 34
The implementation could be found in VGG Model.ipynb, it downloads the pretrained ResNet34 Model. It runs on colab and download the dataset from kaggle, making simple EDAs, training and output statistics logs, uploading the file onto colab and run be sequence of the code blocks should produce relevant output. 

## ResNet With Additional Linear Layers
The implementation could be found in ResNet_AdditionalLayer.ipynb, it is built on top of the baseline ResNet34 model, it runs on colab and download the dataset from kaggle, making simple EDAs, training and output statistics logs, uploading the file onto colab and run be sequence of the code blocks should produce relevant output.

## VGG 19
The implementation could be found in VGG Model.ipynb, it downloads the pretrained VGG 19 Model. It runs on colab and download the dataset from kaggle, making simple EDAs, training and output statistics logs, uploading the file onto colab and run be sequence of the code blocks should produce relevant output.
